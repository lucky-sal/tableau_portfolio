This Dashboard I created was part of a personal passion project. An online shooter video game that I had played a couple years ago. 
The qUestion I was trying to solve was an analysis on projectile damage vs player armor rating. In game there are numerous options and I would have to frequently look up on the wikipedie which ammo grade 
provided the most value. The visual I created was a self service dashboard I could quickly filter to ammo caliber and use the visual to determine which ammo variant was best.
